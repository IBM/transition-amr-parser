I 'm just taking a look <ROOT>
There are so many traitors in the history of China - we need to be vigilant . <ROOT>
With the chaos in East and North Africa , we also had no choice but to prevent the running dog traitors from <unk> with Western imperialism . <ROOT>
Everything has its set number , it 's not time for a change in the weather in China , traitors can only bark <unk> like dogs and nothing else , can only make them disappointed . <ROOT>

Yes . There are many slaves of foreigners . It 's time we should <unk> ! <ROOT>
The ruling authorities actually should pay attention to these kinds of capitulators and traitors of China ! Comrade Deng Xiaoping once said that the Communist Party will not be overthrown - if it falls , it will be brought down from within the party itself . Former US Ambassador to China Mr. Huntsman once said in a speech in the US : we will raise eight hundred thousand spokespeople in China , let the Chinese themselves topple China - and the CIA then used an annual eight million yuan subsidy to help these domestic so - called elite , vowing that they want to let them raise the wind to make waves domestically , citizens definitely need to be alert for this and cannot let outsiders use us . <ROOT>
I have reasons to say this : these last several days I have seen the suggestions given by the experts - with a <unk> I see they are <unk> of Wang <unk> ! <ROOT>
Western society allows these people to see the dawn of fairness and justice of democracy . <ROOT>
The domestic political development is truly too slow , being criticized by people whose ideology is a bit advanced is inevitable . Can we blame others for this ? <ROOT>
Saying that someone is bribed is improper ? <ROOT>
People are all selfish , reality also is often gray . <ROOT>
Some propaganda activities of <unk> have soon become viewed as jokes by the people . <ROOT>
In this environment , what 's wrong if they criticize the previous <unk> propaganda a bit ? <ROOT>
We ca n't look over the old accounts of the previous so - called anti - Japanese war . <ROOT>
Take a look at North Korea , that 's our country many years ago . Take a look at their ridiculous propaganda . <ROOT>
The United States ' dream of occupying the whole world has never stopped , it is constantly being planned . <ROOT>
These days , there 's a kind of feeling that 's more and more intense : It 's that America , through long - term bribing of the Chinese intellectual elite has already succeeded in setting up a " fifth column " . <ROOT>
These people may consider themselves to be culture celebrities or may be of high authority and important position , and are distributed in various circles in society , taking great pains to promote American values * and brainwash the Chinese people on behalf of the Americans . <ROOT>
Why is this kind of feeling getting more and more intense ? <ROOT>
Because these days , I 've been reading part of the " <unk> Professor " blog , it would have been okay if I did n't read it , but after I read it , it made me really surprised . <ROOT>
For example , Assistant Professor Zhang Ming of <unk> University , the political intentions of many of his blogs are extremely obvious . <ROOT>
Such as , in one blog he attributed the reason for the prevalence of hostility in China to elementary school textbooks having " Wang <unk> " , and he <unk> good articles that promote patriotism as not even worth a <unk> . <ROOT>
Another example is so - called " <unk> " and " social activist " Li <unk> - one , her stuff is not similar to things like the <unk> " <unk> <unk> Report " ; two , she has no deep thought ; and three , she has no significant contributions . <ROOT>
She main relies on doing something novel and different and on shocking viewpoints to attract people 's eyes , but without real ability or learning , she 's purely a jumping clown , <ROOT>
This kind of person puts on the big " specialist " hat just to intimidate people ; the key is that she is concerned about politics yet does n't understand politics , is willing to be a slave of foreigners yet is arrogant and overbearing , is ignorant yet feels fine . <ROOT>
Like in the <unk> " A bit less hostility , a bit more harmony " , she completely <unk> class struggle and the anti - pornography - and - illegal - publications drive as social hostility ; <ROOT>
in the <unk> " China has already become the country which worships money most on the earth " , she attributes Chinese society 's worship of money to atheism ; <ROOT>
the <unk> " Are you studying Paul or studying Bill ? " , she <unk> that " people who study Paul will become terrorists " ; <ROOT>
in the <unk> " <unk> for establishment of a constitutional court to solve the problem of pornographic products " , she takes citizens publishing pornographic novels to be freedom of speech , and says the Beijing anti - pornography drive is unconstitutional behavior , etc. <ROOT>
Especially today 's masterpiece , " Why is it worth paying such close attention to the <unk> obscene goods case ? " , where she is once again crying foul over several people suspected of involvement in erotic business activities who are being dealt with by Beijing City , as well as detailing a list of erotic products , with a deeper intent of doing publicity for other people . " <ROOT>
But these kind of <unk> articles actually being put on top by <unk> blog is really preposterous ! <ROOT>
And there is also <unk> poet Liu <unk> , who , while America clear to the eye and with swelling gall engages in containment of China and the people of the whole nation are feeling <unk> , actually comes out with the fallacy " China and America are friendly " , and tries to pour spirit - confusing soup on the Chinese people willfully and without fear ; <ROOT>
Yi <unk> , who got famous by <unk> upon the " three countries " , whose talent and learning I have always respected , but I did n't expect that he was actually supporting the big traitor of China , Mao <unk> , saying some things like " I believe whoever <unk> Mao <unk> is not human " , once again making me very much drop my glasses ! <ROOT>
Also , as for the rumor on the internet a short time ago " Complete notes on 100 Chinese celebrities who accepted political contributions from the Ford Foundation " , I feel that the segment of the intellectual elite in China who are " becoming <unk> " are increasingly <unk> and have already become willful and without fear , to a level of publicly harming the country . <ROOT>
But I do not understand , when these people frequently make <unk> remarks , why no one <unk> them and they , moreover , can continue to occupy high positions , calling the wind and rousing the rain among the <unk> and in public opinion ? <ROOT>
<unk> " Southern newspapers " , which were temporarily fierce a short while ago , I feel that part of the intellectual elite have possibly sunk together with media personalities ! <ROOT>
I remember , 60 - some years ago the US had just fought a war with China , and still threatened China with the use of nuclear weapons ; <ROOT>
40 - some years ago , the US entered Vietnam with the intention of containing China ; <ROOT>
although 32 years ago it had established relations with China , 22 years ago it again started imposing sanctions on China , 12 years ago it bombed a Chinese embassy , 10 years ago the South China Sea collision incident occurred , and two years ago it <unk> its containment of China with great <unk> . <ROOT>
I do n't understand , why are we Chinese so <unk> ? <ROOT>
Why are there still so many people ignoring their conscience and speaking on the behalf of the US ? <ROOT>
Without taking a big loss , people do n't improve their abilities to remember - this is possibly the greatest weakness of us Chinese . <ROOT>
Therefore , it also stands to reason that the forces of the traitors of China are <unk> and the fifth column is running rampant <ROOT>
It 's entirely possible - do n't we ourselves raise " traitors to China " among primary school students ? <ROOT>

A form of <unk> once used to make Kent cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed to it more than 30 years ago , researchers reported . <ROOT>
The <unk> <unk> , <unk> , is unusually <unk> once it enters the <unk> , with even brief <unk> to it causing symptoms that show up decades later , researchers said . <ROOT>
<unk> Inc. , the unit of New York - based <unk> Corp. that makes Kent cigarettes , stopped using <unk> in its <unk> cigarette filters in 1956 . <ROOT>
Although preliminary findings were reported more than a year ago , the latest results appear in today 's New England Journal of Medicine , a forum likely to bring new attention to the problem . <ROOT>
A <unk> <unk> said , " This is an old story . <ROOT>
We 're talking about years ago before anyone heard of <unk> having any questionable properties . <ROOT>
There is no <unk> in our products now . " <ROOT>
Neither <unk> nor the researchers who studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the Kent cigarettes . <ROOT>
" We have no useful information on whether users are at risk , " said James A. <unk> of Boston 's Dana - <unk> <unk> Institute . <ROOT>
Dr. <unk> led a team of researchers from the National <unk> Institute and the medical schools of Harvard University and Boston University . <ROOT>
The <unk> spokeswoman said <unk> was used in " very modest amounts " in making paper for the filters in the early 1950s and replaced with a different type of filter in 1956 . <ROOT>
From 1953 to 1955 , <unk> billion Kent cigarettes with the filters were sold , the company said . <ROOT>
Among 33 men who worked closely with the substance , 28 have died -- more than three times the expected number . <ROOT>
Four of the five surviving workers have <unk> - related diseases , including three with recently diagnosed cancer . <ROOT>
The total of 18 deaths from malignant <unk> , lung cancer and <unk> was far higher than expected , the researchers said . <ROOT>
" The <unk> rate is a striking finding among those of us who study <unk> - related diseases , " said Dr. <unk> . <ROOT>
The percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the West <unk> , <unk> , paper factory appears to be the highest for any <unk> workers studied in Western industrialized countries , he said . <ROOT>
The plant , which is owned by <unk> & Vose Co. , was under contract with <unk> to make the cigarette filters . <ROOT>
The finding probably will support those who argue that the U.S. should regulate the class of <unk> including <unk> more <unk> than the common kind of <unk> , <unk> , found in most schools and other buildings , Dr. <unk> said . <ROOT>
The U.S. is one of the few industrialized nations that does n't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth , <unk> - like <unk> such as <unk> that are classified as <unk> , according to <unk> T. <unk> , a professor of <unk> at the University of Vermont College of Medicine . <ROOT>
More common <unk> <unk> are <unk> and are more easily rejected by the body , Dr. <unk> explained . <ROOT>
In July , the Environmental Protection Agency imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of <unk> . <ROOT>
By 1997 , almost all remaining uses of cancer - causing <unk> will be outlawed . <ROOT>
About 160 workers at a factory that made paper for the Kent filters were exposed to <unk> in the 1950s . <ROOT>
<unk> of the factory were particularly <unk> where the <unk> was used . <ROOT>
Workers dumped large <unk> <unk> of the imported material into a huge bin , poured in cotton and <unk> <unk> and <unk> mixed the dry <unk> in a process used to make filters . <ROOT>
Workers described " clouds of blue dust " that hung over parts of the factory , even though <unk> fans <unk> the area . <ROOT>
" There 's no question that some of those workers and managers contracted <unk> - related diseases , " said Darrell Phillips , vice president of human resources for <unk> & Vose . <ROOT>
" But you have to recognize that these events took place 35 years ago . <ROOT>
It has no bearing on our work force today . <ROOT>
<unk> on money - market mutual funds continued to slide , amid signs that <unk> managers expect further declines in interest rates . <ROOT>
The average seven - day compound yield of the 400 taxable funds tracked by <unk> 's Money Fund Report <unk> a fraction of a percentage point to <unk> % from <unk> % for the week ended Tuesday . <ROOT>
<unk> yields assume <unk> of dividends and that the current yield continues for a year . <ROOT>
Average maturity of the funds ' investments <unk> by a day to 41 days , the longest since early August , according to <unk> 's . <ROOT>
Longer <unk> are thought to indicate declining interest rates because they permit <unk> managers to retain relatively higher rates for a longer period . <ROOT>
<unk> <unk> are considered a sign of rising rates because <unk> managers can capture higher rates sooner . <ROOT>
The average maturity for funds open only to institutions , considered by some to be a stronger indicator because those managers watch the market closely , reached a high point for the year -- 33 days . <ROOT>
Nevertheless , said Brenda <unk> <unk> , editor of Money Fund Report , yields " may blip up again before they blip down " because of recent rises in short - term interest rates . <ROOT>
The yield on six - month Treasury bills sold at Monday 's auction , for example , rose to <unk> % from <unk> % . <ROOT>
Despite recent declines in yields , investors continue to pour cash into money funds . <ROOT>
<unk> of the 400 taxable funds grew by $ 1.5 billion during the latest week , to $ <unk> billion . <ROOT>
Typically , money - fund yields beat comparable short - term investments because <unk> managers can vary <unk> and go after the highest rates . <ROOT>
The top money funds are currently <unk> well over 9 % . <ROOT>
<unk> World - <unk> Dollar , the top - <unk> fund , had a seven - day compound yield of <unk> % during the latest week , down from <unk> % a week earlier . <ROOT>

The average seven - day simple yield of the 400 funds was <unk> % , down from <unk> % . <ROOT>

Regardless of how one views those claims , for many people -- capitalists especially -- <unk> the " victory " of capitalism . <ROOT>

What are your thoughts on capitalism and its activities ? <ROOT>
<unk> , <unk> capitalism has yielded an <unk> . <ROOT>
<unk> regulation is good for <unk> evolution . <ROOT>
Health and safety and environmental horrors need to be regulated otherwise industries will not EVER do whats right for humanity . <ROOT>
<unk> , I do n't have a problem with capitalism -- i have a problem with unregulated capitalism . <ROOT>
I agree with this completely . <ROOT>
Capitalism thrives when everyone understands the rules , plays by the rules and enforces the rules . <ROOT>
If everyone has to spend all their time trying to circumvent the rules , understand the rules or fighting against those not following the rules , that is where trouble really begins . <ROOT>
That 's the problem with " deregulation " . <ROOT>
Removing rules does n't help business be more competitive , it means that businesses must race to the bottom to counter new businesses that start there . <ROOT>
It 's like changing the rules to <unk> half way through the game so that all the previous purchases are meaningless . <ROOT>
That 's not a benefit to capitalism despite what some would tell you . <ROOT>
Out of all of the examples I saw , the only one I would agree with is the bomb <unk> Arab . <ROOT>
That is extremely rude , though I can see the humor in it . <ROOT>
In a college , that kind of costume should not have a place . <ROOT>
But these kids are listing <unk> <unk> , <unk> + donkeys , and a few other <unk> that they deem ' racially insensitive ' <ROOT>
<unk> insensitive ? <ROOT>
Have they not been to Mexico ? <ROOT>
That is a huge part of their dress when you get farther away from the cities . <ROOT>
How is that being insulting ? <ROOT>
It is not showing someone doing something derogatory , it is using the clothes of a society for a costume . <ROOT>
A <unk> is insensitive too . <ROOT>
Again , ( my opinion only ) this is taking it way over board . <ROOT>
Sometimes it seems people look for reasons to be offended . <ROOT>
It is about perspective frankly . <ROOT>
There will ALWAYS be someone who sees something and wants to think the worst of it . <ROOT>
<unk> in a costume or NOT dressing in one will not change that . <ROOT>
And why is it that only those races / cultures are the spotlight of being insensitive ? <ROOT>
Is it not JUST as rude to wear torn over <unk> , stained shirt , black out your teeth and be a white <unk> ? <ROOT>
What about the woman who wears <unk> , high <unk> and too much make up to be a <unk> ? <ROOT>
There has to be a stop to this forever drive to find something insensitive . <ROOT>
And if someone wants to look for reasons they are being held back for what ever reason they have in their heads , they will always find justification no matter what . <ROOT>
But why are we as a so called free society really jumping on board this super PC behavior ? <ROOT>
Why is it now ok to find the smallest thing to be offended about and throw it out as the new discrimination ? <ROOT>
And why are these rules only applied to two or three races ? <ROOT>
Americans , white , black , green , blue , short , tall , fat .. <ROOT>
what have you , are ALL being made fun of in some way when it comes to <unk> and <unk> but only those 3 races get the red light ? <ROOT>
Isnt THAT racist ? <ROOT>
These students are bleeding <unk> and have n't been tempered enough with time and cultural <unk> to realize that one should be able to laugh at oneself and one 's cultural <unk> and that these <unk> are n't the evil mechanisms of racism they are betraying them to be . <ROOT>
This is an absolutely ridiculous thread . <ROOT>
I mean if racist <unk> were actually being banned , you all might have a point . <ROOT>
I am as uptight about the plight of white people in the US as anyone is . <ROOT>
But did anyone else read the article ? <ROOT>
No one is banning <unk> <unk> .. <ROOT>
No one is even talking about banning <unk> <unk> . <ROOT>
In fact no one in this story wants to ban anything , except for the people here who apparently want to ban posters . <ROOT>
These students have a simple goal . <ROOT>
They say " ... if we can change a few people or make a few people think , then that 's awesome " . <ROOT>
They are n't banning anything or stopping anybody from doing anything . <ROOT>
This story is about students expressing free speech . <ROOT>
They are making posters expressing their opinion . <ROOT>
Of course if you want to wear a costume that others find offensive it is free speech . <ROOT>
But me complaining about your costume being offensive is also free speech . <ROOT>
Neither should be banned . <ROOT>
And that is the way it works . <ROOT>
Whether your costume involves black face and a <unk> , or whether it is a <unk> sandwich where I think the cheese is a little too <unk> is irrelevant . <ROOT>
Free speech is free speech and expressing free speech is actually opposite of the " banning " that is being alleged . <ROOT>
You all have turned this story on it 's end . <ROOT>
SO dear <unk> , does she have any chance in <unk> the sitting Republican Senator , Scott Brown ? <ROOT>
Why does Scott Brown need to be <unk> ? I kinda like him ... <ROOT>
Could Elizabeth Warren beat Scott Brown ? <ROOT>
i 'm not sure what either of them look like , but the most brutal fight i ever saw was a girl fight , lots of kicking , <unk> , and some amazing punches ( the loser had to stay home from school for almost a week until swelling went down around her eyes ) <ROOT>
so i 'm gonna say yes <ROOT>
I 'm thinking in terms of the Democratic Party getting one more Senate seat . <ROOT>
In Massachusetts , it would seem a lot easier task then in other Senate races . <ROOT>
I 'm thinking the best thing to do is keep the few moderate Republicans we have right where they are . <ROOT>
He may vote along party lines for most things but he 's reasonable when it comes to representing a liberal - leaning constituency . <ROOT>
Do n't know , but it sounds like a real <unk> contest , does n't it ? <ROOT>
It would have made for some really great off year contest . <ROOT>
Care to explain why you think he is an idiot ? <ROOT>
He did beat Martha <unk> rather convincingly . <ROOT>
He served as a State Senator for several years . <ROOT>
He even voted for several Dem bills . <ROOT>
<unk> was a bad candidate who ran a terrible campaign - I 'll hunt around for a great article I read a year ago outlining the tremendous mistakes she made . <ROOT>
As for Brown , he has a difficult time answering questions about policy in a cogent fashion . <ROOT>
I have seen him on several occasions give answers which show that he has no real understanding of the underlying issue at all , and several which are really just embarrassing . <ROOT>
I have n't really been active in ( or even really cared about ) politics until recently and I 'm really just looking for other peoples opinions on this . <ROOT>
Well , just telling you who I 'll vote for probably wo n't inform you much though right ? <ROOT>
What issues are important to you ? <ROOT>
Obama because I think he has done a good job in most areas ; some areas he let me down , plus there is no way I would vote for a republican today . <ROOT>
( I have a few times in the past , mostly local ) <ROOT>
Anyone who is not a Republican . <ROOT>
I think the majority of them are the reason this country has become <unk> concerning everything that is important . <ROOT>
They are willing to throw America under the bus in order to make Obama look bad . <ROOT>
OK , " and why " does add a lot , you 're right . <ROOT>
I 'm voting for Obama because I think he has done a good job in difficult circumstances , and can do much more with another term , and because I really worry about what any of the possible Republican nominees would do as president if one of them won . <ROOT>
I also would n't vote for just about any republican ( especially Rick Perry ) but I have heard some good things about Ron Paul , he 's about the only republican that I 'm actually interested in learning more about . <ROOT>
My own opinion of Ron Paul is that I 'm happy that he 's in the race , and especially in debates . <ROOT>
I like how he 's anti - war and anti - bullshit in general . <ROOT>
I would absolutely not want him to be president , though . <ROOT>
Andrew <unk> has a lot of posts on him , that might be a good place to start if you 're interested in learning more . <ROOT>
Here 's his un - endorsement of Ron Paul ( he endorsed him , then had second thoughts ) : <ROOT>
I read a fascinating piece in the WSJ today . <ROOT>
The author spoke about how Obama 's approval ratings are at a dismal low . <ROOT>
He apparently appears to be unable to pull Congress together to accomplish much , and in the author 's opinion , it would only get worse if he got elected to a second term . <ROOT>
He would like Obama to bow out for a 2nd term , and have Hillary Clinton run for president . <ROOT>
He believes that Hillary has the best chance of bringing the country together . <ROOT>
I do n't know how she feels about running , but , IMO , I think that it is a great idea . <ROOT>
She certainly has the <unk> , the experience , and the approval of the majority of citizens . <ROOT>
I think that the people on the Republican side of the fence , are a poor bunch . <ROOT>
There is not a one in the bunch who would capture the imagination of the American people . <ROOT>
The voters who will decide this election , IMO are the moderates and the independents . THEY certainly will not vote for any of the anti - gay , pro - life bible bangers . <ROOT>
What do you think ? <ROOT>
Should Obama step down for the good of the country ? <ROOT>
Should Hillary run ? <ROOT>
Hillary 's time has come , and gone ... <ROOT>
She would make her self no friend of the Democratic party by dividing them and losing the black vote ... <ROOT>
No one is going to vote for her that did not vote for Mr. Obama , and a whole lot less Obama voters will vote for her ... <ROOT>
Do n't worry though .. <ROOT>
She has enough sense to not try to run against a sitting president from her own party ... <ROOT>
Best case scenario : Obama gets reelected and the country continues to slide backwards even if the Democrats gain a greater foothold of the US Senate and increase their collective mass in the US Congress . <ROOT>
Worst case scenario : George W. Bush II ( any Republican candidate other then Huntsman , Romney , or Ron Paul ) will take the election . <ROOT>
Then that means the Republicans would likely further gain in Congress and even the Senate perhaps . <ROOT>
Then the country <unk> right back into the deepest of recessions . <ROOT>
I suspect you are wrong on the voting <unk> of the moderates , and especially the ones you call tea baggers . <ROOT>
Actually , I think you are wrong on the moderate / independent voter turnout , too , but I could be wrong . <ROOT>
I 'm expecting a fairly good anti Obama turnout amongst that group . <ROOT>
I could accept Hillary . <ROOT>
Like Phoenix , I 'm not greatly impressed by the Republican field . <ROOT>
Not crazy about the presumed Democratic candidate either . <ROOT>
On the other hand , Obama stepping aside seems even less likely than Cain giving up . <ROOT>
I guess that in summary , I 'm not optimistic about the future of the country for the next five years . <ROOT>
<unk> to NY ! . They realize that it 's not about just voting the party line , it 's about voting for what 's right . <ROOT>
@jcboy , Did they actually vote for gay marriage yet ? <ROOT>
I 'm getting a mixed message with the NY Times <ROOT>
<unk> , They sure did ! <ROOT>
Hopefully , other states will realize gay marriage hurts nobody . <ROOT>
Look at Massachusetts . They have had it since 2004 . <ROOT>
Have you heard of their society falling apart ? Of course not . <ROOT>
I think with NY , then CA , it will rapidly spread across the country . <ROOT>
You ca n't stop this train ! <ROOT>
@jcboy , I hope that the US Congress addresses this issue soon and just makes the whole state by state journey <unk> by making same sex marriage a national law . <ROOT>
@jcboy , You are correct . <ROOT>
Whether one 's home state will recognize a same sex marriage from out of state is another matter . <ROOT>
When I studied the Domestic Relations Law of NY , I thought it was a damned <unk> for a government to give permission to citizens to marry . <ROOT>
The citizens created the damned government , their child . David <ROOT>
Did you guys hear about that plane crash that crashed into a helicopter ? <ROOT>
I have no idea how that happened . <ROOT>
What do you think ? <ROOT>
That is a <unk> <unk> , and when you fly under 1000 feet you have no aid from air traffic <unk> . <ROOT>
<unk> happen , but this particular area may need additional regulation ( such as a minimum <unk> requirement for the tourist helicopters ) . <ROOT>
My husband , our kids , and myself were spending a day out by the <unk> with another couple and their kids , our long - time friends . <ROOT>
At some point we came across a huge fallen tree , and our friend <unk> climbed on it and started walking up . <ROOT>
Our 11 year - old son followed him , but <unk> suddenly realized they wo n't be able to get down that easily . <ROOT>
He turned back and asked our son to get away and down to give him room to get down , too . <ROOT>
Our son stopped but did n't get out of his way at once . <ROOT>
He was having fun , and we had to tell him 2 more times , and then he <unk> . <ROOT>
After that <unk> got back down , and he suddenly <unk> our son from behind and threw him on the ground with all his might , yelling at him . <ROOT>
We were <unk> . <ROOT>
A <unk> 38 year old man could have easily injured him . <ROOT>
Fortunately he got up unscathed albeit very frightened . <ROOT>
We are in deep shock , we never hit our children . <ROOT>
Does anybody know if there are legal ways to teach the man a lesson - but not monetary ? <ROOT>
Is there any point in filing a police report ? <ROOT>
Personally , if someone is my friend , I am going to deal with the situation on a person to person level . <ROOT>
Why ca n't you make it sure that you were really upset and that you do n't want them hitting your kids ever again . <ROOT>
Legally , there are two remedies . <ROOT>
There is monetary damages , and there is jail time . <ROOT>
I suppose you could add probation ( but that is just a replacement for jail time ) . <ROOT>
If you go the legal route , that pretty much ends the friendship no matter what happens . <ROOT>
If I was angry enough to start down this path I would n't worry about where it ended up . <ROOT>
I would probably express my feelings on the situation and make it clear that it was not to happen again . <ROOT>
Your son was <unk> . <ROOT>
That is what the behaviour of your ex - friend would be named legally . <ROOT>
He did n't hurt your child physically , so it was the lesser form of assault ( assault causing physical harm is seen as more serious . ) <ROOT>
You certainly could file a police report .... <ROOT>
I do n't know the law where you are , here , it is quite likely that police would go around and question the man , making it clear that ( if your description is accurate ) he had committed an offence , but you could decide against filing charges . <ROOT>
Again , depending on where you live , you could likely <unk> child protection authorities . <ROOT>
here , being extra - familial , and given that you have already decided not to expose your child to <unk> again , they would simply hand it to police . <ROOT>
If you release a legal <unk> from the bottle , though , you lose control of what the <unk> does . <ROOT>
For instance , you and your son would need to make a formal statement . <ROOT>
It might be that police act even if you do n't want them to . <ROOT>
It might go to court . <ROOT>
I 'd personally not choose to do it <unk> way ... though you could certainly chat to local police without naming names and see if there is such a thing as a stern chat , or a formal caution to be had in your area . <ROOT>
I 'd hope that a stern talk from you and the loss of the friendship would be a big message to him . <ROOT>
However , my concern would be how he treats his own kids . <ROOT>
That was one hell of an over - reaction . <ROOT>
If you have evidence that he assaults his own kids , I 'd be considering a <unk> protection notification . <ROOT>
is your kid ok ? <ROOT>
That would have been scary . <ROOT>
Is he having nightmares or anything ? <ROOT>
I 'd also be having a chat with him about his behaviour . <ROOT>
It did n't warrant such a reaction , but he was <unk> . <ROOT>
If it was really unusual behaviour from your friend , I am a bit worried about him , too , frankly . <ROOT>
I am a 25 year old woman , and I have been in a 2 year relationship with a 37 year old married man . <ROOT>
He has 2 kids one , from his marriage and one from a previous relationship . <ROOT>
He has been planning to get a divorce since the first day we met , <ROOT>
things are so heated between us , I do n't know what to do . <ROOT>
He is planning on moving out of the house by the end of the year , he and his wife do not see eye to eye . <ROOT>
He was having sex <unk> with a lady he met on facebook from Sweden , <ROOT>
when I found out it affected me really badly . <ROOT>
I felt and still feel <unk> and I ca n't trust him . <ROOT>
How do I let go ? <ROOT>
<unk> , You just walk away . <ROOT>
Do you really think so little of yourself that you believe this is the best you can do ? <ROOT>
A married man who if he really was in love with you would just go ahead and file for divorce now , or at least move out of his house now . <ROOT>
A man who while having a relationship with you is involved in sex <unk> online with others . <ROOT>
Personally , when you mess with a married man you deserve exactly what you get . <ROOT>
I have little or no pity for you . <ROOT>
But , you can do yourself a world of good by just walking away from him . <ROOT>
Then why do n't you think about looking for someone who is not attached . <ROOT>
Your odds of finding happiness are a bit better going that route in my opinion . <ROOT>
